# quote-machine
A Free Code Camp intermediate front end project.

[Here is the original CodePen.](http://codepen.io/deynische/details/zKEAZw/)

While the Pen satisfies [FCC's project criteria](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine), I would like to flesh out the project a bit more over time. In the very least, I would rather the dictionaries be in their own file instead of being lumped together with functions. At most, I want to see if I can generate more complex sentence structures based on word types.

More of my thoughts on this project:
